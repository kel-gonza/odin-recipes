# odin-recipes
This is my first project with The Odin Project! 
I incorporated everything that I have learned so far in the foundations course beginning HTML.
In this project I added images, relative links, and played with ordered and unordered lists. This wasn't a hard project and a really fun one since  I added my mother's home country's food, Honduras.
